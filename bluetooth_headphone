Here are the steps to fix the "Connection failed: No audio endpoints registered" error:
Steps to Resolve the Issue

    Install Required Packages:

        Ensure that PipeWire and Bluetooth-related packages are installed:

    bash
    sudo pacman -S pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber bluez bluez-libs bluez-utils

Restart Services:

    Restart PipeWire and Bluetooth services:

    bash
    systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
    systemctl restart bluetooth

Load Bluetooth Modules:

    Load the necessary modules for Bluetooth audio:

    bash
    pactl load-module module-bluez5-device
    pactl load-module module-bluez5-discover

Unmask PipeWire (if masked):

    If you accidentally masked PipeWire, unmask it:

    bash
    systemctl unmask pipewire
    systemctl unmask pipewire-pulse

Remove and Re-Pair Bluetooth Devices:

    Use blueman-applet or bluetoothctl to remove the problematic device and pair it again:

    bash
    bluetoothctl remove <device_mac_address>
    bluetoothctl pair <device_mac_address>
    bluetoothctl connect <device_mac_address>

Reboot the System:

    After applying changes, reboot your system to ensure all configurations take effect.

Verify Audio Endpoints:

    Check if audio endpoints are registered using:

bash
pactl list short sinks

If no sinks are listed, troubleshoot further by ensuring PipeWire is properly configured.
